        If your Android application is obfuscated using Proguard, you can upload a mapping file to have scan results deobfuscated.
        This is not required for scans to be completed.
        However, once a mapping file has been uploaded once,
        all subsequent uploads will require the corresponding mapping file unless the requirement is disabled via the Results API v2.
